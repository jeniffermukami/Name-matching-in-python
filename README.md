When using data, most people agree that your insights and analysis are only as good as the data you are using.
Essentially, garbage data in is garbage analysis out. Data cleaning, also referred to as data cleansing and data scrubbing, is one of the most important steps for your organization if you want 
to create a culture around quality data decision-making.

We do face lots of cases where we have to match a word with a lot of variations. This can be because of typos, pronunciation errors, nicknames, short forms, etc. This can be experienced in the case of matching names in the database with query names. When you need matching of input text to the database we can not expect an exact match always. NLP developers might have gone through scenarios to extract names as named entities and to match it for misspellings and mistranslations.
This project uses a suprisingly effective way of matching scraped hotels names from different websites.
