The first Hungarian Grand Prix was held on 21 June 1936 over a 5-kilometre track laid out in Nepliget, a park in Budapest. The Mercedes-Benz, Auto Union, and the Alfa Romeo-equipped Ferrari teams all sent three cars and the event drew a very large crowd.

Moments of ecstasy, heart-breaking exits, and atmospheres that are as intense as they are palpable. With Pure Sport, you have a chance to experience tennis' most magical moments live. Boasting a footprint on 6 continents and a loyal audience around the world, tennis is certainly one of the most universal sports on the planet. Let us put you in the action with travel packages that are tailored to your needs, so you don't miss out on a single rally. It all began with an announcement in the leisure magazine The Field on 9 June 1877 that \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club, Wimbledon, propose to hold a lawn tennis meeting, open to all amateurs, on Monday July 9th and following days\". A total of 22 men - no women were permitted at that stage - stumped up the ?11 shilling entrance fee, being warned to bring their own rackets and \"shoes without heels\" but that balls would be provided by the club gardener. The All England Club had been founded solely for the purpose of croquet in 1869 on four acres of rented meadowland at Worple Road, Wimbledon but croquet was rapidly overtaken by the new pastime of tennis. Conditions were primitive. A temporary three-plank stand offered seats for 30 people, the total attendance for the final was 200, the rackets resembled snowshoes in shape and weight and the balls had hand-sewn flannel outer casings. Today, Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and widely regarded as the most prestigious.\\n</td>\n",

It takes riders through a fast right-hand first turn, through a left-right hairpin combination and beneath one of Le Mans' most iconic structures - the Bridgestone Tires bridge - before leaving history behind and turning in on itself where the permanent 4.18km circuit is set up. Weekends at Le Mans are always exciting. The hotel is right in the city center, 15 minutes walk from the medieval quarter, and 2 minutes from the tram stop that takes you directly to the circuit. All in all, it?s a very convenient location!

Let us put you in the action with travel packages that are tailored to your needs, so you don't miss out on a single rally. It all began with an announcement in the leisure magazine The Field on 9 June 1877 that \"The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club, Wimbledon, propose to hold a lawn tennis meeting, open to all amateurs, on Monday July 9th and following days\". A total of 22 men - no women were permitted at that stage - stumped up the ?11 shilling entrance fee, being warned to bring their own rackets and \"shoes without heels\" but that balls would be provided by the club gardener. The All England Club had been founded solely for the purpose of croquet in 1869 on four acres of rented meadowland at Worple Road, Wimbledon but croquet was rapidly overtaken by the new pastime of tennis. Conditions were primitive. A temporary three-plank stand offered seats for 30 people, the total attendance for the final was 200, the rackets resembled snowshoes in shape and weight and the balls had hand-sewn flannel outer casings. Today, Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and widely regarded as the most prestigious.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

It takes riders through a fast right-hand first turn, through a left-right hairpin combination and beneath one of Le Mans' most iconic structures - the Bridgestone Tires bridge - before leaving history behind and turning in on itself where the permanent 4.18km circuit is set up.
